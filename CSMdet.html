        <h2>VETERANS OF THE LONG WAR</h2>
        <p>At the start of your Command phase, select one unit from your opponents army to be your focus of hatred. Until the start of your next Command phase, each time a HERETIC ASTARTES model from your army (excluding DAMNED models) makes an attack that targets your focus of hatred, you can re-roll the Hit roll.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="contentContainer">
        <h2>DECEPTORS</h2>
        <p>In the Declare Battle Formations step, you can select a number of LEGIONARIES and CULTIST MOB units from your army: until the end of the battle, those units, and any CHARACTER units attached to them (excluding EPIC HEROES), have the Infiltrators ability. The maximum number of units you can select in this way depends on the battle size, as shown below.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="contentContainer">
        <h2>Renegade Raiders</h2>
        <p>Ranged weapons equipped by HERETIC ASTARTES models from your army have the [ASSAULT] ability, and each time a HERETIC ASTARTES model from your army makes an attack that targets a unit within range of an objective marker, improve the Armour Penetration characteristic of that attack by 1.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="contentContainer"> 
        <h2>Dread Talons</h2>
        <p>In the Battle-shock step of your opponentâ€™s Command phase, if an enemy unit that is below its Starting Strength is within 12" of one or more HERETIC ASTARTES units from your army, that enemy unit must take a Battle-shock test. 

            Each time an enemy unit within 12" of one or more HERETIC ASTARTES units from your army takes a Battle-shock test, subtract 1 from the result. 
            
            Enemy units affected by this Detachment rule do not need to take any other Battle-shock tests in the same phase.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="contentContainer">  
    <h2>FELLHAMMER SIEGE-HOST</h2>
        <p>Each time a ranged attack targets a HERETIC ASTARTES unit from your army (excluding DAMNED units), if the Strength characteristic of that attack is greater than the Toughness characteristic of that unit, subtract 1 from the Wound roll.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="contentContainer"> 
        <h2>PACTBOUND ZEALOTS</h2>
        <p>When mustering your army, when you select a HERETIC ASTARTES unit to include in your army, if that unit is not an EPIC HERO and does not already have one of the following keywords, you must select one for that unit and note it on your Army Roster: KHORNE. TZEENTCH, NURGLE, SLAANESH, CHAOS UNDIVIDED. Each time a unit with one of these keywords gains a weapon ability as the result of a Dark Pact and does not fail the resulting Leadership test, until the end of the phase, that unit gains the associated ability below.</p>
    </div>
    <div class="contentContainer"> 
        <h2>CHAOS CULT</h2>
        <p>Each time a DAMNED unit from your army with the Dark Pacts ability is selected to make a Normal or Advance move or declare a charge (excluding units that arrived from Reserves this turn), it can make a Desperate Pact (see below). If it does, until the end of the phase, add 2 to the Move characteristic of models in that unit and add 2 to Charge rolls made for that unit. </p>
    </div>
    <div class="contentContainer"> 
        <h2>SOULFORGED WARPACK</h2>
        <p>Each time a HERETIC ASTARTES DAEMON VEHICLE unit from your army makes a Dark Pact, it can invoke its contract. If it does, subtract 1 from the resulting Leadership test when making that Dark Pact, and until the end of the phase:
        <br>Each time a model in that unit makes a ranged attack, add 1 to the Wound roll.
        <br>Add 2 to the Attacks characteristic of melee weapons equipped by models in that unit.</p>
